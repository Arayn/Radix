# Radix
Minecraft-compatible client and voxel engine using libgdx.

## Project Goal
Radix was originally created so that I could learn OpenGL (although its since been moved from LWJGL to the more abstracted libgdx).

More recently the project has been transformed into an attempt to make a faster and cleaner Minecraft client (although I'm not sure if the cleaner part is quite there yet...).

## Features
* Join Minecraft servers
* Walk around
* Break blocks (creative, some survival support)
* Place blocks
* Render the world (greedy meshing, block/sunlight, fake AO)
* Chat
